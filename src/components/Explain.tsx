            <h2>WTF is this?</h2>
            <p>
                Nothing special. Just a memecoin for those crying over $UST and $Luna fiasco. We are not mocking you, we just wanted to give you something for your worthless tokens.
            </p>
            <h2>Do $TEARS have any value?</h2>
            <p>
                No, not at this point. We just wanted to distribute them to comemorate these unfortunate events. Hopefully we will be able to provide liquidity in the future once the markets recover. 
                
                We are also thinking about NFTs. Open to ideas!
            </p>
            <h2>Which network is this on?</h2>
            <p>
                BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain; BSC)
            </p>
            <h2>What is the supply?</h2>
            <p>
                Max and total supply is 10,000,000 $TEARS. 95% is in the faucet contract. the remaining 5% is left in the deployer wallet for future liquidity addition.
            </p>
            <h2>Who is the team?</h2>
            <p>
                Meh, who cares. There is no plan, no roadmap, no nothing. Just a memetoken. Do not redeem it or burn it if you don't want it. 
            </p>
            <h2>Are there any team tokens?</h2>
            <p>
                No, just the 5% is reserved for liquidity.
            </p>
