            <h2>WTF is this?</h2>
            <p>
                Nothing special. Just a memecoin for those crying over $UST and $Luna fiasco. We are not mocking you, we just wanted to give you something for your worthless tokens.
            </p>
            <h2>Do $TEARS have any value?</h2>
            <p>
                No, not at this point. We just wanted to distribute them to comemorate these unfortunate events. Hopefully we will be able to provide liquidity in the future once the markets recover.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the supply?</h2>
            <p>
                Max and total supply is 10,000,000 $TEARS. 95% is in the faucet contract. the remaining 5% is left in the deployer wallet for future liquidity addition.
            </p>
            <h2>Who is the team?</h2>
            <p>
                Meh, who cares. There is no plan, no roadmap, no nothing. Just a memetoken. Do not redeem it or burn it if you don't want it. 
            </p>
            <h2>Are there any team tokens?</h2>
            <p>
                No, just the 5% is reserved for liquidity.
            </p>
